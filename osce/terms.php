    <h5>Resit Coverage</h5>
    At OSCE Toolbox, we understand the challenges and pressures that pharmacy students face, especially during their OSCE exams. In recognition of our commitment to supporting our users, we are pleased to introduce the "Resit Coverage" scheme.

    <br>
    <br>
    Users will receive the following benefits:

      </li>
        <li>
        Continued support and access to our educational materials to enhance exam preparation during the resit period.
        </li>
    </ul>

    To be eligible for the Resit Coverage scheme, users must meet the following criteria:

      </li>
