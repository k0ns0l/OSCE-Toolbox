        We envision that our resources will help you practise your OSCE skills along with your peers. Use our scenarios and our digital marksheet to practise anywhere at any time! Finding it hard to meet up with people? That's fine, with our Discord server find other students across the UK to practise with at your leisure. If you want to work alone you can access our cheat sheets and video scenarios to revise.
