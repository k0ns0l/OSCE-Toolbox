      <div class="title">The problem</div>
      <p>There is a lack of OSCE resources for pharmacy students prior to their final year of study, especially those that accommodate specific university curriculums. Currently, most resources are outdated options such as textbooks, which can be disengaging, generic, and inconvenient.</p>

    <div class="col-sm">
      <img src="assets/img/about-3.png" class="att2">
      <div class="title">Our solution</div>
      <p>We want to provide pharmacy students across the UK with OSCE resources that are not only reviewed by qualified pharmacists, but also come with approved mark schemes. And to make preparing for exams easier, you can access our OSCE guides, our video scenarios, or practise with your peers across the UK in our Discord server.</p>
