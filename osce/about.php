      <div class="title">What is OSCE Toolbox?</div>
      <div>OSCE Toolbox is an organisation looking to support pharmacy students with their OSCEs. Currently, we are a team of university students working in collaboration with representatives from other universities and qualified pharmacists. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Our aim is to boost performance and confidence in OSCEs, because we know they can be scary!

      <div class="title" style="text-align:left">Where did we come from?</div>
      <div>OSCE Toolbox started as a small project to support medical students with OSCEs, as the founder noticed a lack of specific resources targeting this, and a lack of knowledge surrounding the OSCE process. 
      <br>
      <br>
      However, it became apparent that this issue was much more prevalent within the UK pharmacy community, so we aim to solve this problem. </div>

      <div class="title">The problem</div>
      <p>There is a lack of OSCE resources for pharmacy students prior to their final year of study, especially those that accommodate specific university curriculums. Currently, most resources are outdated options such as textbooks, which can be disengaging, generic, and inconvenient.</p>

      <div class="title">Our solution</div>
      <p>We want to provide pharmacy students across the UK with OSCE resources that are not only reviewed by qualified pharmacists, but also come with approved mark schemes. And to make preparing for exams easier, you can access our OSCE guides, our video scenarios, or practise with your peers across the UK in our Discord server.</p>
